# Java to x86_64 Toy Compiler

## Built on Yacc and Bison

This is only a first stage compiler, capable of a very small subset of Java features:

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Variable declarations
- Simple control structures (if statements, loops)
- Basic I/O operations
  
  Will update in the future
